# Two phase merge sort

## Compliation and execution

Compile with `g++ -std=c++14 -o tpms main.cpp`
Execute with `./tpms <input_file> <output_file> <memory_to_use> [no_of_threads] <asc/desc> <list_of_columns (space separated)>`

For single threaded execution, no need to enter anything in `[no_of_threads]`
